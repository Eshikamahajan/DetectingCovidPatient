# Detecting Covid patients using Image classification

# Disclaimer
This project is an attempt to classify COVID Patients from the dataset containing X-Ray images of normal patients and COVID infected patients.
However the model is not accurate enough to be held responsible alone for the classification and hence I make no claim for the diagnostic performance of the model.
For more information please visit https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

The dataset for the project is taken from kaggle as well as the above repository.
